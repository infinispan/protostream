/**
 * Protobuf messages do not indicate their message type or structure. Readers of protobuf data streams are expected to
 * know in advance what message type to expect next in the stream. Also, the wire format is not self-delimiting so the
 * length of the next message must be known in advance of be detected correctly so that not too much nor too little is
 * read. This is particularly important is multiple messages are contained in a stream.
 * A detailed explanation is oferred here: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/techniques#streaming
 * <p>
 * WrappedMessage solves this problem of self-describing messages by allowing the stream reader to detect
 * the type of the message. Still, the message structure is not provided as it would not be efficient to carry the type
 * descriptor over the wire with each message. The application is expected to have knowledge of the structure once it
 * learns the type name.
 * <p> This is similar to 'google.protobuf.Any' but is also able to handle scalars not just messages.
