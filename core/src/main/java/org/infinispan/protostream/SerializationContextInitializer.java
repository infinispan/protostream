/**
 * An interface to be used in conjunction with the {@link org.infinispan.protostream.annotations.ProtoSchema}
 * annotation. By creating an abstract class implementing this interface or an interface extending it and annotating it
 * with {@link org.infinispan.protostream.annotations.ProtoSchema} the compiler (via a custom annotation
 * processor) will generate a concrete implementation for you to use. The implementation will provide a single schema
 * file that is generated based on the annotations and also marshallers for all the contained types.
 * <p>
 * You can also use the sub-interface {@link GeneratedSchema} instead, which provides methods to access the generated
 * schema file.
 * <p>
 * Manually written implementations of these interfaces are allowed, but are of no special use with regard to
 * ProtoStream library.
