/**
 * A marshalling bridge for another class that cannot be annotated. This class will handle marshalling for it by
 * defining its schema via annotations.
 * <p>
 * The class bearing this annotation will have an annotated factory method for the marshalled class and annotated
 * accessor methods for each field. These methods can be instance or static methods and their first argument must be
 * the marshalled class. Annotations must be placed only on methods. Direct field annotation is not allowed.
 * <p>
 * This class must be thread-safe and stateless and must have an accessible no argument constructor. A single instance
 * of it will be created per SerializationContext.
